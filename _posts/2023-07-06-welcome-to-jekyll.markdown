Hello All, I'm Marlon Chalegre, graduated in Computer Engineering from Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE) and MSc in Computer Engineering with an emphasis in Computational Intelligence. In my academic history, I published two articles and teached algorithms, mathematical logic and mobile development in universities.

About the articles, the first article is ["A new approach using hidden Markov model for generating movie captions to aid the hearing impaired, which is capable of visual encoding emotional information"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7885748/) and the second one is ["An adaptive support system for phonological treatment of phonetic disorders using visual feedbacks and Speech Recognition"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7435941/).

In industry, I've been working in a lot of different tecnologies like Web, Mobile platforms and Embedded Systems and filed two patents, PRINTING DEVICE COMPONENT STATUS CLASSIFICATION (US PCT/US2018/058622) and SISTEMA PARA INFORMAR TRABALHADORES SOBRE REGRAS REFERENTES À MARCAÇÃO DE PONTO (BR BR 10 2017 018356 4).

Currently, I work as Software Engineer at Nubank.

Welcome!
